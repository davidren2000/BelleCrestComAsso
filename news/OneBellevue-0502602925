    <p>Hello One Bellevuers,

Some of you might have heard about this, but I hadn't until I read  a Neighbors Chat message from Leslie Gellar of Eastgate today. I imagine that other OneB members do not know about it either.

I was unable to forward it so I have restated it here with her permission.

This is a rare opportunity to ask questions of Planners and Councilmemembers and receive a reply!!!
 You can also state your opinion on these changes which go far beyond the state mandate.

Middle Housing Conversation
with members of Planning Committee and some Councilmembers.
Somerset Elementary Gym 6:30pm
14100 Somerset Blvd. SE
Sponsored by Somerset Community 

In 2023, HB 1110 was approved to increase housing and diversity of types *Middle Housing* in SF housing zones across the State. The Bellevue Planning Dept's proposed Land Use Code goes far beyond the State minimum. Some Council members disagree with the Planning Dept recommendations. Five of our seven Councilmembers are up for re- election this year. Primary is in August, Election in Nov. This is one of your last opportunities to voice your concerns 

Planning Dept recommends

1  up to 6 units in SF zoned neighborhoods.
2. Higher heights 38ft. or 4 stories 
3.Increase house footprint, greatly decreased setbacks. 
4. Up to 9 housing types can be combined on the same lot.
5. Reduced tree coverage.
6. Reduced off street parking. The Co-housing option is very troublung in this regard. Each person is allotted .25 parking space. So, 10 tenants 8n 1 house would have 2.5 spaces.
7. Two units attached to a home do not count as additional dwellings or buildable square footage. Thus, could have up to 8 units perlot.
8. All likely to be market rate.

Please inform neighbors and invite them to attend.
